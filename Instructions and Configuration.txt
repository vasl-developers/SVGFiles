My development environment, other configurations are possible.

Install Cygwin https://www.cygwin.com

Install Rust Toolchain. https://rust-lang.org

Check out vasl_svg_counters and check out or extract VASL vmod

	The directory/folder for vasl_svg_counters and the VASL vmod should be in the same parent folder
	(e.g., my cygwin home folder is "C:\cygwin64\home\Gordon" and contains the sub-folders "vasl_svg_counters"
	and "vasl-6.6.8").
	
	Within the cygwin command window:
	
		cd vasl_svg_counters

		To compile the executables and generate the vehicle and gun SVG counters (into the folder "../vasl-6.6.8/images") for all the nationalties.
			
			bash run_all.sh "../vasl-6.6.8/images"

		To clean the executables/libraries and remove all generated SVG files.
	
			bash clean_all.sh

		To complile the executables and generate JUST the vehicle SVG counters (into the folder "../vasl-6.6.8/images") for all the nationalities.

			bash run_vehicles.sh "../vasl-6.6.8/images"

		To complile the executables and generate JUST the gun SVG counters (into the folder "../vasl-6.6.8/images") for all the nationalities.

			bash run_ordnance.sh "../vasl-6.6.8/images"

		To complile the executables and generate the vehicle SVG counters for a single nationality (into the folder "../vasl-6.6.8/images").

			cargo run --bin generate_vehicle_counters "../vasl-6.6.8/images" < data/allied_vehicles.csv

		To complile the executables and generate the gun SVG counters for a single nationality (into the folder "../vasl-6.6.8/images").

			cargo run --bin generate_ordnance_counters "../vasl-6.6.8/images" < data/axis_ordnance.csv
