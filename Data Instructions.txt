Ordnance and vehicles spreadsheets format:

Columns "A" through "N" for ordnance files, and "A" through "AB" for vehicle files, are filled with the counter data "scraped" from Klas' Chapter H website. The remaining columns are for additional data used in processing each entry.

Any row that has "ignore" in the "overrides" column (column "R" for ordnance and "AE" for vehicles) is skipped during processing.

The 1st row contains the column identifiers used by the Rust programs ("generate_ordnance_counters" and "generate_vehicle_counters") to deserialize the data from the spreadsheets into a data structure for processing.

The 2nd row contains the column identifiers used in the original Klas Malmström's tables (https://www.klasm.com/ASL/Listings/VehicleListings.html and https://www.klasm.com/ASL/Listings/OrdnanceListings.html) and aids in aligning the original data with the spreadsheet columns (this row should have "ignore" in the "overrides" column).

Spreadsheet updating/editing:

"version" column - Records the version of each counter, increment when the counter data is updated.

"piece" column - Identifies the VASL piece name (e.g., "ton212" corresponds to the Amercian 2 1/2 ton truck counter depicted by "ton212.gif"/"ton212.svg" in the "images/am/veh" folder. Multiple pieces (e.g., German Heer and Waffen SS) counters can be generated from the same row.

	1. If multiple pieces should be generated from the same row of data, the first piece name is matched to the "nat=" override (if present or selected from the first 2 letters of the piece name).
	
	2. Subsequent pieces are separated by the '|' delimiter and must have "@<XX>" appended to the piece name.
	
	3. Example: in the axis_vehicles.csv "axPziB|huPziB@hu" will generate the "common" Axis Minors Pz IB and the "Hungarian" Pz IB counters from the same data.
	
"overrides" column - Specifies "overrides" to values within the counter's spreadsheet data. Multiple overrides for a counter are separated by '|' characters, e.g., "ma=40L|mp=13".

	ASTERISKS - For all of the following overrides where asterisks may be specified the format is:
	
		"[*]" - 5-lobed (star) asterisk (check the back of the counter for corresponding note).
			
		"<*>" - 6-lobed asterisk (check the vehicle listing for the corresponding note).

		"[b*]" - Force 5-lobed (star) asterisk to be displayed in black.
		
		"[w*]" - Force 5-lobed (star) asterisk to be displayed in white.
		
		"<b*>" - Force 6-lobed asterisk to be displayed in black.
		
		"<w*>" - Force 6-lobed asterisk to be displayed in white. gemhack add support for Waffen SS counters
		
		"[_*]" - 5-lobed (star) asterisk on the MA caliber underline (e.g., British "Deacon" vehicle).
		
	ALTERNATE LOCATIONS - Many of the following overrides may have the elements moved to an alternate location. These are specified by:
	
		"@in_gs"		In the "gun stack" along with (typically) the main armament, rof, breakdown, etc.
		
		"@mgs"			Where the machine guns are normally shown.
		
		"@above_mgs"	Above where the machine guns are normally shown.
		
		"@before_tow"	In front of the towing number. 
		
	FONT SIZE CHANGES - Many of the following overrides may have their font size changed by a positive or negative delta.
	
		"@sz-<x.yz>"	Reduces the font size, e.g., "@sz-1.00" reduces the font size by 1 pixel.

		"@sz+<x.yz>"	Increases the font size, e.g., "@sz+1.50" reduces the font size by 1.5 pixels.
		
	SUBSTITUTION - An override can access the original field's value (stripped of any daggers) for modification.
	
		"$$"		Inserts original field's value (stripping out any dagger/notes), e.g., if the main armament field contained "128L†", then "ma=<*>$$" would result in the main armament being overriden to "*128L" (without the dagger/note and with a 6-lobed asterisk in front).
		
	"announce"		Print the contents of the "count" column of the spreadsheet as text.

	"far=<XX>"		Front armor. e.g., "far=8" changes the front armor value to "8".

In general, you'll find multiple examples of each of these overrides in the spreadsheets, or find an existing counter in Chapter H that has the feature you are looking for and see which (if any) overrides were used to produce the current counter.

"svg_image_transform" column - Allows unique scaling, rotation, and translation of the unit depiction image displayed on the counter. See the appropriate SVG documentation.

"comments" column - Allows inclusion of counter-specific comments to be included in the header block in the counter's SVG file.

"r_x" column - Ordnance only, specifies unique repair/disable values intended for the malfunction side of ordnance counters (which are currently not generated).

"limbered" column - Ordnance only, allows modification of various displayed values specifically for the "limbered" version of the counter. "no_fire" indicates that a "non-firing limbered" counter should be generated. Otherwise modifiers from the list of "overrides" above are valid.
